   There are a few requirements in our project that we have deemed to be necessary for most online software projects. Requirements 1, 2, 3, 4-1, 5, 6, and 7-1 are all assumed to be required. This is because these requirements make any program easier to use, code, and maintain, resulting in the program becoming functional and efficient. Other requirements, such as 2-2, 2-2-1, 4, and 7 are all specific to our program and are used to test the functionality according to our design principles.

   For requirements 2-2 and 2-2-1, they are necessary as the database will have a large number of data entries and any user must discern between them, being able to search for any specific data point. For requirement 4, we need to make sure that no one user is borrowing too many books, which is specific and necessary to the book borrowing aspect of our program. Similarly, requirement 7 is specific to our project as we require two different types of user accounts, customers and employees, so that the database may be edited by select individuals.

   Overall, we have selected these requirements to be both general and specific to our program. Generally, we required certain things that would help our program function and be efficient, like requirements 4-1, 5, and 6. On the other hand, the rest of our requirements are specific and necessary to the way our program functions.
